# Using-diet-Analysis-to-predict-child-malnutrition

This project is the capstone project of hamoye internship.

Using diet analysis to predict child malnutrition involves examining a child's dietary intake to assess their risk of malnutrition. 
The objective is to identify nutritional deficiencies or imbalances in a child's diet that may contribute to malnutrition and its associated health consequences.

The analysis typically involves evaluating the child's dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and food diversity. 
Various metrics such as the adequacy of energy, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), 
and overall dietary quality are considered. This analysis can be done through methods like food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour dietary recalls,
or dietary assessment tools.

The tech stack typically involves a combination of data analysis tools like matplotlib, seaborn and programming language as python for data processing and analysis. 
6 Machine learning regression algorithms and Deep learning algortithms are trained to analyze the dietary data and predict malnutrition risk. 

The collected data is then processed, cleaned, and analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and risk factors associated with child malnutrition. 
The predictive models developed are evaluated and validated using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques to ensure their accuracy and reliability.
